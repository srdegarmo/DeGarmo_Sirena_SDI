 //BASIC EXPRESSIONS

 var a = 2; //sets up variable & defines it with 2
 a = a + 3; //takes value of a+3 and stores it in a
 console.log(a); //if we want to add to a and change a, we use an assignment operator

var a = 2; //sets up variable & defines it
var b;
b = a + 3; //store value of a+3 inside b
console.log(b); //will show you value of a+3
console.log(a); //will show you value of a

//EXAMPLE EXPRESSIONS - AGE

 var yearBorn = 1994; //define age first
 //2012 - yearBorn; defines expression, but doesn't have a variable to store the answer
 var age = 2015 - yearBorn; //create variable to store result
 console.log(age);

 //ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

 //area of triangle = half of the width * height
 // var area; is the variable for result
 var width = 4; //given
 var height = 5; //given
 var area = 0.5 * width * height;
 console.log(area);

 //MODULO OPERATOR - gets remainder of division

 var remainder = 32%10 //tells us what's left over when we divide 32 by 10
 console.log(remainder);
